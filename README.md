A full-stack app built as part of Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" on Udemy allows authorized users to create and manage campground postings, leave star ratings and reviews, and view the campgrounds on a cluster map. Users can post details such as name, image, description, cost, and location. The result is a functional and user-friendly app that facilitates camping trip planning and sharing experiences with others.
